What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
- Staging area is an intermediary location before committing into the repository. It is yet to be versioned, however getting ready before being committed.

Staging area allows for organizing of files to be included in a commit. Even if we were working across multiple files at once, only the required files can be selected for committing.
